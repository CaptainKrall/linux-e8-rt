This is Linux kernel based on 3.0.8 with RT_PREEMPT patch (rt23)
for EmbedSky E8 mini-PC based on Samsung S5PV210 Cortex A8 SoC.

=== NOTE ===
Some of the precompiled modules (having *.module extension) which
were shipped with the original (non-RT) kernel will fail to link
into the RT-kernel. Following modules are known to fail linking:

- sound/soc/samsung/snd-soc-wm8960.module
- sound/soc/samsung/snd-soc-s5pv210-wm8960-e8.module
- drivers/input/touchscreen/gx801.module
- drivers/input/touchscreen/gt811.module
- drivers/media/video/samsung/fimc/ov3640.module
- drivers/media/video/samsung/fimc/saa7113.module
- drivers/media/video/samsung/fimc/ov9650.module
- drivers/media/video/samsung/fimc/tvp5150.module
- drivers/media/video/samsung/fimc/tq_auto_detect.module

Possible workaround to make these devices work in the RT-kernel
is to decompile needed modules and then compile them from source.
